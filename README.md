# Project-Ushvathama---Personal-Desktop-and-Voice-Assistant
This is a personal desktop assistant which will do few tasks for you. It is currently in level 1 development process where the tasks which can be performed are limited and need manual coding for it instead of any automation.

### What can you do with USHVATHAMA : 

* Ask time and day
* Ask to open google,brave,youtube,stack overflow
* take screenshot of current screen
* record your voice

The current code is very rigid and has fixed to perform particular task. Looking forward to improve the effectiveness of the assistant and automate it.

## What are the requirements of workspace to run the program 

<p>
    <h3>Installing libraries</h3>
    <br><i>pip install speechRecognition</i> - To give commands to <strong> USHVATHAMA </strong> and perform tasks.</br>
    <br><i>pip install opencv-python</i> - This module is used to access camera for capturing images.</br>
    <br><i>pip install PyAudio</i> - This library helps USHVATHAMA to speak ask which task to perform from the user.</br> 
</p>

## Future work to be done : 
* Automating USHVATHAMA as much as possible, training a model and integrating it with the code so that the rigidness in the commands can be eliminated and the assistant can respond to the commands accordingly even if phrased differently.
* Making the code understandable to any individual, make it robust in nature.
